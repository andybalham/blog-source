# What are the parts going to be about?

## Part 1: Messaging Choice

- Introduction to the book
- Outline the business problem
- Mention the example uses MSMQ, ask the question about serverless
- Talk about [sns vs sqs vs EventBridge](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=aws+sns+vs+sqs+vs+eventbridge&ia=web)

### `jest.config.js`

We needed to add this to allow the use of `crypto.randomUUID()`.

```javascript
  globals: {
    crypto: {
      randomUUID: () => require('crypto').randomUUID(),
    },
  },
```

## Testing

- Highlight how it is straightforward to implement mock functions with an event-driven architecture
