What is our story?

* We want to show how we can use CDK to encapsulate a set of components that offer functionality that we can reuse in different scenarios.

## TL;DR

* CDK can be used to build reusable functionality ???

## The application

TODO: Describe the state machine

## The requirement

We want to add retry functionality

## The solution

Idempotency, two Lambda functions and an SQS queue

Explain the two-taps approach

## The implementation

Show how we can build a CDK construct that we can reuse

## Testing 

Step through capturing a set of errors, then retrying, failing again, then succeeding

## Summary

Highlight how we now have
