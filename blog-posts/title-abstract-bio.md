# Title

Building testable event-driven applications with the AWS CDK

# Abstract

Serverless technology simplifies the creation of event-driven applications, but how do go about testing these as we develop them? Here we look at how the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) might come to the rescue, giving us a way to construct these serverless applications out of individually testable building blocks.
