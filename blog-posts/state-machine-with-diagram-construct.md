Challenges:
* Finding `toGraphJson`
* Naive `new sfn.StateGraph` that results in already
* Move to `new cdk.Stack()` and `getDefinition`, but with states outside
* Note use of `Omit`
* Refactor to include all definitions in a method
* Refine to extend props to have location of the diagram

Now we have v1 to v3 to talk through.
